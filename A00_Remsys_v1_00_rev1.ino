/*   version 1.00, Ron D Bentley (Stafford UK) March 2020.

This framework provides a basis for the development of applications that would benefit from timed 
reminder alerting.  Timed reminder alerts can be defined/created as elapsed time reminders (ETRs)or
as real-time reminders (RTRs) linked to a real-time clock (RTC).  Any number of reminders can be 
active at any one time, dependent on the size of the Reimder List initialised.
